IntroductionWhere disruptive technology taking us leave it disruptive technology creates jobs depleted jobs notice jobs disappearing jobs jobs transform humans robots machines technology creating machines replace them Technology creates data analysis tools manipulate create custom scenarios artificial intelligence (AI) Big Data Machine Learning (ML) algorithms predict drive consumer behavior Data Analytics tools Google Analytics  today free and correctly organizations save millions billions dollars marketingHow machine replace humansBefore on it’s level set constitutesmachines context article  machines describe computers computerized equipment robots programmed learn humans Occasionally Artificial Intelligence (AI) times machine learning times robotics yes technically things bots efficient humans specific domains growing smarter passing day tough tasks considered difficult human being But broad discussion related future work totally interrelated Factory floors deploy robots increasingly driven machine learning algorithms adjust people working alongside them machine work efficiently abundant data information work imparted them forward step & advancement technology threat proliferating threat replaced work front passing sealing jobs humans globe Similarly turn handdrawn sketches (done humans) digital source codeRole Machines Companies futureCompanies developing robotics expertise idea technological innovations they’ll tocut costsincrease efficienciesoffer propositionsexecute business models orall aboveOf course it’s machines creatives working either example Amazon employed 100000 robots warehouses efficiently move things increased warehouse workforce 80000 Humans Amazon’s case picking packing goods robots move orders giant warehouses essentially cutting “down walking required workers making Amazon pickers efficient tired” Plus robots “allow Amazon shelves cars rushhour traffic longer aisle space humans greater density shelf space inventory roof selection customers”Why Machines replace humansDuring decades (or sooner) notion work handled human virtual hinge predictability starting today machines manage routine humans unpredictable – tasks require creativity problemsolving flexibility context robotics improve operations efficiency improve quality life workersAlthough obvious human factors involved work activity impact job automation highly repetitive tasks—and mechanical ones—are ideal robots greater efficiency speed automation leads risk accidents greater control autonomy all fewer costs organizationsAre Machines diligent humansAlthough artificial intelligence machine learning make robots endowed superior intelligence fact don’t ability learn experience respond unknowns things stand processing automatic learning robot has doesn’t beat factors innate human brain Humans essential part process delivering services client customer challenges routine humans play important role addressing issues solving time appear consolidating process systemMachines vs Humans – premiumWhile machines humans proximity robots expensive doesn’t apply types based Robotic Process Automation (RPA) development process incorporates algorithms significantly reduce costsMoreover domestic robots—be vacuum cleaner lawn mower cleaner—are increasingly part lives level consumption robotics attained makes affordable automate tasks modern homes obtain greater control security comfortMan Machines togetherThe division humans machines clear – I’m here machine – boundary fuzzier prosthetics fuse seamlessly bodies making lost limbs providing additional strength stability resilience exoskeletons donned assembly line workersWe smartphones symbiotically integrated directly bodies smartphone form contact lens capable transparently delivering augmented reality images brain sounds science fiction again prototypes builtSoon braincomputer interfaces seamless well creating synergistic relationship us point question moot question answer answer stored neural circuitry time connection neurons web brain’s decision process influenced “educated” cultural context external factors influencing decision processes point situations legitimately claim influence brains can’t accountable choices made point I’m make humans symbiosis cultural environment tools – physical conceptual – taught use transformation subtleConclusionPractically speaking robots growing point world start creating smarter robots impractical concern expected future shot you’ve ATM waited PC boot catastrophic failure game crash reach checkpoint understand world machines perfectly right jobs theirs’ flawlessly then depend humans mess livesThis isn’t winorlose situation We’re wind partner smarter machines partnership fostered augmentation technology Machines play essential role augmentation and successful technology fall level perception end revolution silent invisibleBlackcoffer Insights 29 Swapna G Nivashiniya R Sri Manakula Vinayagar Engineering College(SMVEC) Puducherry
