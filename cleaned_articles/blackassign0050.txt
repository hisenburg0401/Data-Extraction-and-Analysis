Covid 19 pandemics forced factories shut down flights canceled massive decrease global economy significant decrease Gases (GHG) developed developing countriesThe SARS CoV2 spotlight 2019 impacted countries till then 131 infected worldwide resulting deaths 29 World Health Organisation (WHO) countries dealt virus imposing strict lockdowns social distancing control spread virus policies caused adverse effects worldwide important impacts Covid19 Pandemic environmentThere positive impacts environment due lockdown like air pollution decreased dramatically people asked stay houses due lockdowns decline environmental noise Environmental noise defined unwanted harmful outdoor sounds caused human activities noise emitted road traffics air traffics rail traffics industrial activities important challenges modern noise pollution adverse effects humans harm animals too imposition lockdown quarantine nation’s governments caused people remain homes this movement people reduced significantly personal public transport decreased Due changes environmental noise generated cities dropped substantiallyWater Pollution beaches reduced significantly animals spotted cities covid19 virus generated negative indirect effect environmentTo begin with developed countries halted sustainability program pandemic United States nationStates waste recycling plants suspended municipalities cities due

consumption demand fossil fuels due transportation mobility goods individual enormous upsurge medical waste products employed healthcare professionals singleuse items disposed of wastes include masks personal protection kits gloves instance 200 tons medical waste generated pandemic breakout Wuhan China 50 tones average waste generated outbreak WuhanThese organic inorganic wastes generated due policies crafted government takes heavy toll environment environmental issues water pollution air pollution soil erosion harm local faunaThe demand masks pandemic skyrocketing materials required production masks highly dangerous environment generally composed nonwoven fabrics Polyester Polystyrene polyethylene polycarbonate common materials surgical density lying 20grams 25 grams/sq meter materials resistant liquids plasticbased products afterlife discarded treated properly discarding end filling landfills oceans making dangerous aquatic lifeforms example recently environment started degrading drastically pandemic accumulation clinical wastesWith recycling plants hold piles mountains wastes depositions open areas formed due increasing number unrecycled wastes generated day makes surrounding vulnerable creating risk air pollutions dumped open wastes decays Methane (CH4) greenhouse gas increasing risk global warming too surroundings affected careless methods local people affected excess methane accumulated Earth’s atmosphere due piles unrecycled wastes result increases Earth’s average temperature harmful future generationsMany protected endangered fauna facing greater risks due imposition lockdown countries lockdown made people stay inside homes employees NGOs volunteers working protected areas National Parks Conservation Zones wildlife sanctuaries made stay home
