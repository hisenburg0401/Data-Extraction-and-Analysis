Title: AI Machine Learning Statistics and Data Mining - what is the difference


“Data oil” important trendline 21stcentury reason advancements related data analysis Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining data developing staggering pace popular buzzwords daysBuzzwords originated technical terms underlying essence fashionable impress reason misconception people AI ML Stats Data Mining related analysis data mistook thing words interchangeably convey thing allThe similarity disciplines disciplines related analysis data converting data “information”In academics learning Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining academic approach wander technical definitions concepts underlying essence aim discipline remain unexplored articles explain difference Thus primary confusion learners Hence article explains difference explaining philosophy aims disciplines wandering technical definitionsThen difference Machine Learning Statistics Data MiningThe essential difference disciplines lies “aims” approach achieve aimsThe aims explained detail sectionsArtificial IntelligenceThe aim Artificial intelligence understand intelligent entities satisfy aim understand intelligence makes agent intelligent agent answer questions found studying intelligent agents intelligent agent found standing front mirror Yes Humans examples intelligent entities Thus 1900s researchers began exploring thought process reasoning process humans human beings considered ideal intelligent agent Mimicking human behavior aim initial years research setting goal studies experiments began famous experiment conducted initial years achieve aim Turing Test Turing defined intelligent behavior ability achieve humanlevel performance cognitive tasks sufficient fool interrogator test received criticism mimicking human behavior intelligence intelligence related working human human brain intelligence meaningThus mimicking human thought processes reasoning transformed aim Psychology philosophy resonate aim understand human thought process difference understand thought process mimic it build it collaboration resulted models Neural Networks mimic function neurons present human brain So basically initial aim humancentered humans considered ideal intelligent agentConcurrently computer science developing greater pace advances computer science experiments theories easily tested validated programs applied solve reallife problems found computers performed humans tasks complex humans examples chessplaying program program defeated world’s chess Kasparov incident human intelligence ultimate intelligence human defeat program leads question human intelligence ideal intelligenceAs computers advanced proved humans complex tasks thenew definition intelligencewas related ability solve cognitive tasks problems So nature agents researchers began study nature intelligence itself question test validate intelligence test intelligence solve cognitive problems agent intelligent solve complex problem problemsolving approach easily tested validated computers Thus researchers began studying ideal intelligence selected agent validate experiments computer So computer problemsolving approach adopted So humancentered approach computer problemsolving approach aims AI contributed giving valuable insightsBoth aims important collaboratively form aim AIMachine LearningIn problemsolving approach big challenge overcome order achieve aim solving math problem cases intelligence tested problemsolving approach math problems solve problem familiar problem notConsider problem problem familiar you solve kind problems solved similar problems past So question mind solve problem answer is solved similar problems past learned past data solve problems haven’t problem past solve similar problems form intelligenceConsider problem solved kind problems past solve problem consciously gather manipulate information reach conclusion kind approach necessarily rely past data completely reasoning process kind intelligenceFor build intelligent agents kinds intelligence developed agent But reality reached point build agents learn past data find information today reached point build agents own type intelligenceSo implement type intelligence Machine Learning So domain focuses solely implementing kind intelligence fact Machine Learning reason ML called subset AI So difference MLTechnically speaking “It study computers ability learn past data find meaningful conclusions patterns explicitly programmed” statement elaboration essence ML related process “Generalization” learning past data Generalization abstraction common properties specific instances formulated general concepts claims humans recognize life objects animal easily recognize “dog” “cat” trivial task wondered mind it answer GeneralizationIf picture dog easily recognize picture dog because minds abstracted description dog formulated “concept” dog concepts learned past experiences dog So dependent fact things represented generalized concepts mindsWith generalization only “information” So give computers ability generalize “raw data” convert “information” patterns trends data ownStatisticsThis discipline concerns collection organization analysis interpretation presentation data Statistics data aim explain it So study explaining data itself Statistics domains Descriptive statistics Inferential statisticsDescriptive statisticsdeals explanation description data “Descriptive” statistics explain information possible easily data complex task otherwiseInferential statistics make accurate inferences data inference tasks lives simple cooking soup completing recipe taste sample is spoonful soup check soup tastes bad Depending result sample make inference soup soup whole bad Similarly statistics cases apply inference meaningful information example gather data timeconsuming costly cases applying inference based introduces uncertainty inferential statistics helpSo data context uncertainty decisionmaking face uncertainty statistics deals with So however data statistics explain data aim resonate ML statistics helpthese correctly interpret dataData Mining“Data” raw form examples sensors industrial applications sensors manufacturing sense properties temperature pressure etc raw data generated sensors converted suitable form processed analyzed gather valuable insights solve problemDue unique aim capturing essence datasets gather insights Data Mining referred “Knowledge Discovery” why Fiorina CEO HewlettPackard said “The goal turn data information information Insight” statement completely explains aim Data MiningSo difference Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining lies aims approaches fields fulfilling aims fields beauty fieldsBlackcoffer Insights 25 Abhishek Govekar Vishwakarma Institute Technology Pune India
