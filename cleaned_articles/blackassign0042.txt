AbstractThe work destined undergo massive transformational impact humans ways working dramatically development machine programs AI set humans workplace did competition beings robots too robots overcome workAt present surrounded AI dusk till dawn facial recognition present mobile application dating websites/applications decision making algorithms learn past data well believed AI grown 270% yearsFirst AI fuss itAI defined internet simply ‘simulation human intelligence machines programmed humans mimic actions’ translates to work human 100% accuracyIn definition define AI god form human beingsNow question arises is AI entails futureAI fancy continue existing minds time limitations threats peaceful sleep workers introduction areas workplace clear half human jobs AI arise jobs humans upcoming AIbased ventures industries giving share usIn survey found believed devastating humans professionals techsavvy people believed inculcating technology business lives remarkable step lead

‘Artificial Intelligence’ represents ‘Humans’Artificial intelligence works algorithms neural networks deep learning analytical tools taking analytical decisions based data providedWhereas humans higherlevel decisions based ‘Intuition’ sometimes refers gut feeling generates humans situation challengeAI can’t work handle critical situations humans reciprocate share information stakeholders humans can’t anticipate accurate fastpaced analytical solutions problems persisting situationThe strength humans working synergy surprisingly beneficial advantageous organizationsARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE JOBSIt believed machines future eating traditional jobs reality turning otherwiseThe future trend shows future AIpowered technology jobs humans return produce jobs require human interference them newer technology approaching countries proceeding GIG Economies future witness increase freelance jobs permanent labor market norms reduce drasticallySome jobs today replaced

it’s unclear future holds us anticipation benefit waysAs unclear future like probable terms turn employ specific training programs employees organizationThe training employees needed continuous lifetime basis education won’t limited PG degrees lifetime process learningAs Covid19 changed scenario work patterns world strategically working dynamics future compared precovid postcovid scenarioEmployees playing role transforming organizations work practices upcoming future organizations select recruit candidates provide practices machines make proficient area work Policies developed hire people retaining talent organizationThere continuous scanning environment organizations comprehend trends assess them trends beneficial organizations aware prospects plan future systematically consistentlyCONCLUSIONThere lies possibility future years now machines general human intelligence answer deep meaningful questions ‘Why curtains blue’ clean cars play politics jokes us deep machine learning programs level intelligence mathematical calculations us That’s machines future make competitive machines train impending ambiguous future ahead usHumans machines work synergy beneficial
