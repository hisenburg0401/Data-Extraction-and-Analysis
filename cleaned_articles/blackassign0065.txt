Title: Will we ever colonize outer space? - Blackcoffer Insights


Nature blessed humanity earth rounded globe essential necessity lies human 21stcentury building Space shuttle exploring space obvious activity human raise inclusion Startups Space dreamed reaching space coming true agree fact Growth industrialization generated humungous carbon footprint colonize outer space create muchneeded area survivalWith time human visualized undergone transformations transformations starters effective role existence age natural transformation shifting tectonic plates manmade Dumping water damaging water bodies affected usual life humans creating space humans humans eyeing forAll idea Colonizing outer space emerged NASA launch space shuttle heavy payload late 1990s idea didn’t stir time eyes articles astronauts writeup limelight idea progression space exploration normal companies petrified number investments kinds projects for things change entry PayPal’s owner Elon Musk 2002 laid stones Space X NASA providing launchpad explorationBeing space travel legitimate bottlenecks knowing nature outer space boost idea colonizing realize optimum target company put forward themself planet earth safely earlier projects due fund subdued priority rocket technology Thus unimaginable quest search space farfetched thoughNow 2020 find colonizing space kind emergence technologies led escalation spreading roots human existence plan reaching outer space plays role idea too Proper Planning Analysing Organising Executing required projects successful deeper mention Space X wud successful sending Rockets 2022 colonize 2050 achieving vision planned total 36 times prelaunch rocket launching 2020 satellites provide basic network connectivity colonized world planned extent targeted profit $ 22 2025 manned rocket successfully Elon musk plan create infrastructure cost regular air flight ticket lead chances colonizing planet setting commercial flight started planet wud stepping colonizing outer spaceBut fundamental change people undergo living planet change gravity live support technical issues arise suit find similar earth change humans adjust Aspects Ultraviolet rays play immense role survival rate technology expanding challenging boundaries days left find solutions aspects idea colonizing monetary terms projected building colony space cost $10 Trillian countries GDP Placing amount funding highly anticipated projects tough Elon addressed questions open Door believes cost find route colonize space costs justifiable space exploration reach heightsAlso world water percentage comparison water less population increasing level excitement order search things obsession innovative things finish end satisfy achieved things crave achieve thatIn order achieve planning crucial stage searched 9 planets didn’t shortlisted outcomes 3decade theory ELON MUSK possibleAs important thing survive atmospheric environment suitable not order make suitable steps maintain suitable level oxygen missions focusing about Finding source water 2ndcrucial thing needed surviveApart excitement things threats uncertainties bound happen kind mammal occur construction that security protection uncertainties replicatedAfter basic things factors natural habitats there plants grown not yes types plants survive thereThe environment animals safe not balance nature types animals natural habitat insects things ignorable plays important role maintaining environmental balance eg – Ants leading predators insects helping pest populations low Ants move approximately amount soil earthworms loosening soil process increasing air water movement ground ecosystem clean dead insect carcasses aid destruction decomposition animal matter So thing contributes wayAnother matter concern level artificial intelligence machine learning required maintain kind requirement current scenario energy run vehicle robotics So availability energy source energy neededAnd this heat equally important order maintain level artificial air survive long So order remain healthy calculation done thinking disease news concern antibiotics (such penicillin) – fight infections – eventually stop working Global health organisations reduce antibiotics conditions aren’t serious overuse recent years they’re effectiveBut survive antibiotics ways dealing diseases caused bacteria isolation treated penicillinIt sound set firmly realm fantasy experts private industry governments world understand feasible establish lunar base scientists humans survive comfortably moon ways minimal gravity conducive life microgravity astronauts experience International Space StationAlthough hasn’t formally tested experts hypothesize amount gravitational force put astronaut’s body stem adverse effects bonedensity muscle loss space flyers experience living microgravity International Space StationBy moon’s indigenous material space agencies save cost flying pricey missions moon’s surface moon stage costly missions aimed delivering oxygen resources Earth experts material manufacture gasses needed sustain life satelliteOn earth protected radioactive solar winds cosmic rays magnet magnetosphere space can’t rely type protection order make protection lot upgraded technology achieveAlthough till approximate project $10 trillion aim make fare equivalent normal air fareAs comfortable resources securities uncertainties risk analysis probability survival human factors consideration development won’t timeBecause construct building 89 months totally acceptableBut concern density land ie capacity weight not type adaptable cultivation nor converted types cultivation upgraded technologyIn order transport equipments regular basis amount fuel required factors Built propellor depo rocket landing building infrastructure create forward idea Colonizing outer
