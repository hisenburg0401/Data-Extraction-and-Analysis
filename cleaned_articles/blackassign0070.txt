Title: How does artificial intelligence affect the environment - Blackcoffer Insights


talk AI people perspectives it group people knowledge potential AI solution problems world facing today group people threatened thought taking worldThe birth Turing 1950 thought “Can machines think” 1980s adoption “expert systems” companies world booming initiated Initially matter awe results achieve AI’s growth past decades exponential transformed live work solve challenges made impact wide variety areas including healthcare education business more But areas highest impact made recently environment climate changeIs Revolutionizing Environment Climate ChangeAI strengthen climate predictions enable smarter decisionmaking decarbonising industries building transport work allocate renewable energy recent years gamechanger people organizations climate change Microsoft believes artificial intelligence encompassing machine learning deep learning “gamechanger” climate change environmental issues company’s ‘AI Earth’ program committed $50 years create test applications AIAI increasingly manage intermittency renewable energy incorporated grid handle fluctuations improve energy storage well Wind companies turbine’s propeller produce electricity rotation incorporating realtime weather operational dataAI improve energy efficiency scale incorporating data meters Internet Things (the internet computing devices embedded everyday objects enabling send receive data) forecast energy demand Besides artificial intelligence systems simulate potential zoning laws building ordinances plains planning disaster preparedness vision sustainable create “urban dashboard” consisting realtime data energy water availability traffic weather make cities energyefficient livableHotter temperatures significant impacts agriculture well Data sensors monitor crop moisture soil composition temperature improve production crops watering Incorporating information drones monitor conditions increasingly automatic systems times plant spray harvest crops diseases problems result increased efficiency enhanced yields water fertilizer pesticidesBut downsideWhen talk effect environment climate coin elucidated So positives discussed above usage downsideLast year’s World Economic Forum report showed address Earth’s environmental challenges important manage properly forum experts field potential accelerate environmental degradation powerintensive GPUs run machine learning training cited contributing increased C02 emissionsAlthough half century question environmental impact – ethical issues – arising techniques developed decades combination explosion data computational powerFor advances enabled artificial intelligence speech recognition selfdriving cars systems consume lot generate volumes climatechanging carbon emissionsA study found training offtheshelf languageprocessing system produced 1400 emissions – amount produced flying roundtrip Francisco ways make machine learning cleaner greener movement called “Green AI” algorithms powerhungry others example training moved remote locations renewable sourcesThe key however developers companies machine learning experiments spewing volumes reducedWhat doneTo prevent this proposition World Economic Forum report advancements “safe” pursued ensure humanity developing harmful environment Specifically World Economic Forum report developers “must incorporate health natural environment fundamental dimension” safeguarding models demand consumption energy natural resources sustainable factors sense programs designed dimension environmental protection improvement mindIn future development programs important note environmental impact creating systems place academic study energy usage deep learning processes creation effective costly environment 300000 kilograms carbon dioxide equivalent emissions created process training single model basically equal emissions average cars United States negative environmental impact addition positive implications climate change crucial moving forwardThere room improvement pioneers machine learning recently published paper calledTackling Climate Change Machine Learningwas discussed conference Rolnick postdoctoral fellow University “call

Tracking carbon emission agendas UN 2020 UN’s goal prevent coal plants built Satellite images picture deep learning techniques data science researchers analyze quality satellite images track emission Google expanding horizon nonprofit’s satellite imagery including gaspowered plants emissions researchers track pollution countries organizations govern CO2 emission ground level data unreachable global monitoring associationsAI automate analysis images plants regular updates emissions introduces ways measure plant’s impact crunching nearby infrastructure electricity use That’s beneficial
